# Grafana Backup System - Setup Complete! 🎉

## ✅ Initial Backup Created

Your first backup has been successfully created with the following components:

1. **SQLite Database Snapshot** ✓
   - Location: `backup/snapshots/daily/grafana.db.gz`
   - Size: 70KB
   - Compressed with gzip

2. **Alert Configurations** ✓
   - Alert rules exported
   - Notification policies exported
   - Contact points exported
   - Mute timings exported

3. **Dashboard Export** ⚠️
   - Requires API authentication configuration
   - Can be done after setting up authentication

## 📊 Import Backup Health Dashboard

To import the backup health dashboard into Grafana:

### Method 1: Via Grafana UI (Recommended)

1. **Access Grafana**
   - Open: http://localhost:3001 or http://grafana.local
   - Login: admin/admin (if not changed)

2. **Import Dashboard**
   - Click **Dashboards** → **New** → **Import**
   - Click **Upload dashboard JSON file**
   - Select: `/dashboards/backup-health.json`
   - Or paste the JSON content directly
   - Select **Prometheus** as the data source
   - Click **Import**

3. **Verify Dashboard**
   - Dashboard should appear as "Backup Health Dashboard"
   - Check that panels are loading (metrics will appear after backups run)

### Method 2: Via API (After Authentication Setup)

```bash
# First, create a service account token in Grafana:
# Configuration → Service accounts → Add service account → Generate token

# Then export the token:
export GRAFANA_API_KEY="your-service-account-token"

# Import dashboard:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/dashboards/db \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAFANA_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d @dashboards/backup-health.json
```

## 🔐 Configure API Authentication

To enable full backup functionality (dashboard exports):

1. **Create Service Account**
   - Go to: Configuration → Service accounts
   - Click: Add service account
   - Name: "backup-service"
   - Role: Admin (or Editor)
   - Click: Create

2. **Generate Token**
   - Click on the service account
   - Click: Add service account token
   - Name: "backup-token"
   - Click: Generate token
   - **Copy the token immediately** (shown only once)

3. **Save Token to Environment**
   ```bash
   # Create ~/.env file
   echo 'GRAFANA_API_KEY="your-token-here"' >> ~/.env
   ```

4. **Test Authentication**
   ```bash
   source ~/.env
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $GRAFANA_API_KEY" \
        http://localhost:3001/api/health
   # Should return: {"database": "ok", "version": "..."}
   ```

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Complete Dashboard Import** (if not done)
2. **Set Up API Authentication** (for full functionality)
3. **Run Complete Backup**:
   ```bash
   make backup-all
   ```
4. **Check Backup Health**:
   ```bash
   make backup-status
   ```
5. **Test Restoration** (dry run):
   ```bash
   make backup-restore-dry
   ```

## 📈 Monitoring Your Backups

Once the dashboard is imported and metrics start flowing:

- **Overall Health**: Shows GREEN/YELLOW/RED status
- **Last Backup Age**: Tracks time since last backup
- **Storage Usage**: Monitors backup size growth
- **Integrity Status**: Validates backup integrity
- **Git Hook Activity**: Shows automated backup triggers

## 🔄 Automated Backups

Git hooks are already configured and will:
- Trigger backups after config commits
- Validate before pushes
- Sync after merges

To set up daily scheduled backups:
```bash
make backup-schedule  # macOS LaunchAgent at 2 AM
```

## 📚 Documentation

- Full documentation: `backup/README.md`
- Makefile help: `make help`
- Configuration: `backup/configs/backup.conf`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **First Dashboard Import**: Since this is a fresh Grafana instance, you'll import the dashboard manually via UI
2. **Metrics Collection**: Backup metrics will appear in the dashboard after running backups
3. **API Authentication**: Required for exporting dashboards created/modified in UI

## 🎯 Quick Test

Test the backup system:
```bash
# Create a test backup
make backup-snapshot

# Check status
make backup-status

# View in dashboard (after import)
# http://localhost:3001/dashboards
```

Your backup system is now operational! The SQLite database is safely backed up, and the monitoring infrastructure is ready. Complete the dashboard import to visualize backup health metrics.
